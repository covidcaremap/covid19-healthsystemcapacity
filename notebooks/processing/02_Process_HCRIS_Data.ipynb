    "\n",
    "> Study Design and Data Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "> We performed a repeated-measures time series analysis of US ICU bed supply during the 16-year period between 1996 and 2011. We obtained data on hospital characteristics and intensive care occupancy from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Hospital Cost Report Information System (HCRIS), a publicly available hospital-level database with detailed information on structural, organizational and cost data for all US hospitals. We excluded skilled nursing facilities, long term acute care hospitals, hospitals located in US territories and stand-alone pediatric hospitals (1, 2). We augmented the HCRIS data with data from the US Census Bureau’s 2010 urban-rural classification file which we used to designate hospitals as urban or rural by ZIP code (5).\n",
    "\n",
    "> Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "> The primary dependent variable was each hospital’s number of ICU beds compared to the previous year. We defined total ICU beds using the summed counts of four HCRIS bed categories that were available throughout the study interval: intensive care beds, surgical intensive care beds, cardiac intensive care beds and burn intensive care beds \n",

    "Column 2--Refer to 42 CFR 412.105(b) and 69 FR 49093-49098 (August 11, 2004) to determine the facility bed count. Indicate the number of beds available for use by patients at the end of the cost reporting period.\n",
    "\n",
    "A bed means an adult bed, pediatric bed, portion of inpatient labor/delivery/postpartum (LDP) room (also referred to as birthing room) bed when used for services other than labor and delivery, or newborn ICU bed (excluding newborn bassinets) maintained in a patient care area for lodging patients in acute, long term, or domiciliary areas of the hospital. Beds in post-anesthesia, post- operative recovery rooms, outpatient areas, emergency rooms, ancillary departments (however, see exception for labor and delivery department), nurses' and other staff residences, and other such areas that are regularly maintained and utilized for only a portion of the stay of patients (primarily for special procedures or not for inpatient lodging) are not termed a bed for these purposes. (See CMS Pub. 15-1, chapter 22, §2205.)\n",
    "\n",
    "For cost reporting periods beginning prior to October 1, 2012, beds in distinct ancillary labor and delivery rooms and the proportion of LDP room (birthing room) beds used for labor and delivery services are not a bed for these purposes. (See 68 FR 45420 (August 1, 2003).)\n",
    "\n",
    "For cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2012, in accordance with 77 FR 53411- 53413 (August 31, 2012), beds in distinct labor and delivery rooms, when occupied by an inpatient receiving IPPS-level acute care hospital services or when unoccupied, are considered to be part of a hospital’s inpatient available bed count in accordance with 42 CFR 412.105(b) and are to be reported on line 32. Furthermore, the proportion of the inpatient LDP room (birthing room) beds used for ancillary labor and delivery services is considered part of the hospital’s available bed count.\n",

    "Column 8--Enter the number of inpatient days for all classes of patients for each component. Include organ acquisition and HMO days in this column. This amount will not equal the sum of columns 5 through 7, when the provider renders services to other than titles V, XVIII, or XIX patients.\n",

In accordance with the instructions in 68 FR 45420 (August 1, 2003), compute this proportion (off the cost report) by multiplying the total number of occupied and unoccupied available beds in the LDP room by the percentage of time these beds were used for ancillary labor and delivery services. An example of how to calculate the “percentage of time” would be for a hospital to determine the number of hours for the cost reporting period during which each LDP room maternity patient received labor and delivery services and divide the sum of those hours for all such patients by the sum of the total hours (for both, ancillary labor and delivery services and for routine postpartum services) that all maternity patients spent in the LDP room during that cost reporting period. Alternatively, a hospital could calculate an average percentage of time maternity patients received ancillary labor and delivery services in an LDP room during a typical month.\n",

The proportion of available LDP room beds related to the ancillary labor and delivery services must not be excluded from column 2 for those cost reporting periods.\n",
    "In columns 5, 6, 7 and 8, enter the number of adult and pediatric hospital days excluding the SNF and NF swing-bed, observation bed, and hospice days. In columns 6 and 7, also exclude HMO days. Do not include in column 6 Medicare Secondary Payer/Lesser of Reasonable Cost (MSP/LCC) days. Include these days only in column 8. However, do not include employee discount days in column 8.\n",

    "This notebook gathers the HCRIS information based on the following inputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The hospital data at http://downloads.cms.gov/files/hcris/hosp10-reports.zip \n",
    "  - HOSPITAL10_PROVIDER_ID_INFO.CSV (`HOSPITAL10`): Provides facility level IDs, names and addresses\n",
    "- The 2018 reporting data from http://downloads.cms.gov/Files/hcris/HOSP10FY2018.zip\n",
    "  - hosp10_2018_RPT.CSV (`HOSP10_RPT`): Provides facility report information.\n",
    "  - hosp10_2018_NMRC.CSV (`HOSP10_NMRC`): Contains the numeric column values that are linked back to the report data from above.\n",
    "- A data dictionary at https://www.cms.gov/files/zip/hospital2010-documentation.zip\n",
    "  - HCRIS_DataDictionary.csv: provides report column codes with titles.\n",
    "\n",
    "It then takes the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Join the `HOSPITAL10` data and `HOSP10_RPT` to get all information about a facility per report.\n",
    "- Filter the `HOSP10_NMRC` to only those line numbers and columns we care about\n",
    "  - Filter `Line Number` to keep information about Staffed Beds, Staffed Bed Days, and Inpatient Days AND\n",
    "  - Filter `Column Number` to keep information concerning the numeric counts related to: \n",
    "    - Hospital Adult and Peds\n",
    "    - Intensive Care Unit \n",
    "    - Coronary Care Unit\n",
    "    - Burn ICU\n",
    "    - Surgical ICU \n",
    "    - Total\n",
    "- Join the filtered `HOSP10_NMRC` data to the previously joined `HOSPITAL10` and `HOSP10_RPT` data.\n",
    "- Aggregate counts for 'Intensive Care Unit', 'Coronary Care Unit', 'Burn ICU', 'Surgical ICU' into 'ICU Total Staffed Beds',  'ICU Total Bed Days Available', 'ICU Total Inpatient Days'.\n",
    "- Calculate 'ICU Occupancy Rate' and 'Total Bed Occupancy Rate' using the ratio of Inpatient Days to Bed Day Available for ICU and over all totals. If the '* Bed Days' columns are not available, then compute them by using the number of staffed bed multiplied by the number of days between the report's Fiscal Year Begin Date and Fiscal Year End Date\n",
    "- The resulting dataset will have information per Record per Facility. Some facility have multiple records. Choose the record with the 'Fiscal Year End Date' being the most recent.\n",
    "- Drop problematic facilities, e.g. PARKVIEW MEDICAL CENTER which reports 2,290,239,239 total beds. \n",
    "- Join with the `usa_hospital_beds_hcris2018_geocoded.geojson` dataset based on 'Provider Number', generate a new GeoJSON file that contains all aggregated counts and other relevant HCRIS information with this joined data.\n"
