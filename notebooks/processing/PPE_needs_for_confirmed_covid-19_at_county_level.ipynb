    "\n",
    "**The input data is the confirmed covid19 cases at county level** (Data from [USAFacts](https://usafacts.org/visualizations/coronavirus-covid-19-spread-map/). We load this data when the notebook runs from [this url](https://usafactsstatic.blob.core.windows.net/public/data/covid-19/covid_confirmed_usafacts.csv) using `covidcaremap.cases.get_usafacts_cases_by_county`. Note that running this notebook on different days will produce different results as it will use the latest data. We took in the newly added case daily for the PPE needs estimation. \n",
    "\n",
    "The PPEs are consumed through the covid19 patient flow that has shown in the above diagram. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to make the estimation, we assumed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 14% test cases are tested as positive. This can change from county to county. \n",
    "- 80% of the confirmed positive cases will have very mild symptoms and only need home care; while\n",
    "- 20% of the confirmed cases will end up in in-patient care; \n",
    "- 40% of patients from in-patient care may need critical care. \n",
    "\n",
    "- A patient may have about ten-room visits from doctors and nurses per day in in-patient care; but \n",
    "- A patient in critical care may need a room visit every 20 - 30 mins from doctors, nurses, other room visits may come from therapists, ventilator technicians. We assume 40 room visits per day for a critical care patient.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each patient need a ventilator in critical care;\n",
    "\n",
    "- A patient may spend seven days in in-patient care;\n",
    "- A patient may spend an average of 10 days at critical care. \n",
